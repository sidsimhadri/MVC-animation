This is an MVC based animation program. Based on the users input, it can either textually render an animation, output it to an SVG file, or visualize it with Java swing with or without interactive controls.
All the code in the Provider folder as well as the interfaces that start with Provider is not mine.
These were given to me by another group working on the same project. To demonstrate the flexibility of the model I designed, I made my code work with a provided textual view and  interactive swing view. To help me do this, I was given the interfaces for the other groups model and controller class in addition to their fully implemented views.
